Team 8

The following are the parts of the final search engine according to:
  
    http://weblog.cs.uiowa.edu/cs2820f14/Sixth%20Project%20Assignment
    
We have agreed to break this up into the following parts:
    Part 1.   Chong & Will
    Part 2.   Joshua Kinney
    Part 3.   Tanner Woody
    Part 4.   MISSING
    Part 5.   Tim Miller
    
For Part 4, we will collaborate that evenly. Will and Chong also have agreed to tackle this after Part 1 is done.

Several of us will also be looking online at Parsers (which is a build of regex).
